About

WoW Helper Ver 3.a

I originally wrote this little clicker to autofire
mouse button 3 as I have a bit of rheumatism in my
hands and fingers and wanted an easier time when
spamming the mouse buttons. Later on I found I was
using the keyboard more so removed the mouse buttons
from the program and it evolved in to this. 

A simple program allowing rapid fire from almost any
key on the keyboard. This works well when coupled with
Gnome Sequencer in WOW but could be used with any game.

I also added a feature to fire your combo points by
reading a user defined area of the screen. Pick the
key you want it to trigger then add a macro to your
bar in game and bind that key to it for the spell to
fire.

I can be found at some point most days playing WOW on
Terokkar just give tHE.alCHMist a yell if you have a
problem or have found a bug and maybe I will answer you.
 
Greetz to anyone I know :)

The BGM playing now is one of Ocean Softwares C64
cassette loaders from the 80's (Loader4).
