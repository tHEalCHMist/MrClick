MrClicky Ver 1.a 
  
A simple program allowing rapid fire from
most keys or mouse buttons, good when coupled
with Gnome Sequencer in WOW but can be used
with any game as it simulates keypresses or
mouse button clicks.
I also added a feature to fire your combo 
points by reading when the fith one is filled.
Pick the key you want it to trigger then add a
macro to your bar in game and bind that key to
it for the spell to fire. Add some checking
like [combat][@target,harm,nodead] so it only
fires when you target something alive and are
actually fighting.
